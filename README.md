## Introduction

This project focuses on understanding the common issues customers face with various banks. By analyzing the data, we aim to provide banks with actionable insights to improve their services and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Data Collection

The data was collected from various sources, including customer feedback, complaint logs, and publicly available datasets. The dataset includes the following banks:
i will not display the names of the banks for integrity of the banks, however i used random banks

## Data Processing

The data processing steps include:
1. Cleaning the data to remove any inconsistencies.
2. Normalizing the bank names to ensure uniformity.
3. Categorizing the complaints into different issue types.
4. Aggregating the complaints by bank and issue type.

## Visualization

The visualizations were created using Python and Plotly. They provide a clear representation of the number of complaints over time for each bank, broken down by issue type. This helps in identifying trends and problem areas quickly.
